# HYDROGRID Frontend Coding Challenge

How to run:

```sh
cd path/to/frontend-coding-challenge
npm install
npm start
```

This will open the browser **with more instructions**.

## What to edit

You only need to edit 3 files for this coding challenge:

- src/Task1.tsx
- src/Task2.tsx
- src/Task3.tsx

## Visual Studio Code is recommended

The repo has configuration and recommended extensions for VSCode - but you can do the challenge
without installing any of the extensions, or of course using any other IDE.

## Vite vs create-react-app

This repo is using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) instead of create-react-app/react-scripts.
If you are used to create-react-app, using vite is similar, but more lightweight and startup is faster.
